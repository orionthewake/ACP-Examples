Solve single channel quantum mechanical scattering problems with the momentum space T-matrix method.  An S-wave  square well potential is considered. Output is the scattering momentum, the phase shift (computed in two ways), and the exact result. Required input is the particle masses, the partial wave, the strength of the square well, the range of the square well, and the number of Gauss-Legendre integration points.

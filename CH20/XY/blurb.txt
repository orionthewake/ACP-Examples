Metropolis algorithm solution for the two-dimensional XY problem (which explores the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition). Output is the spin-spin correlation function, the average spin, the magnetization, and the system energy. Required input is the system temperature, the system size, update protocol parameters for thermalization, autocorrelation, and measurements, and an option for the initial configuration.

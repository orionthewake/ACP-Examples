Stochastic guided random walk solution to the quantum one-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Evaluates the ground state energy and the ground state expectation value of the staggered magnetization. Input is the length of the spin chain, the anisotropy g, the number of random walks, dtau, tau1, tau2, the lag for evaluation of the ground state energy, gruidance parameters A and B, a random seed, and an option for the initial spin configuration.

Finite element method solution to flow rate through a rectangular channel with fluid velocity fixed at the top surface. Required input is the number of grid points in the x and y directions, the aspect ratio of the channel, the pressure gradient, and the fluid velocity at the top of the channel. Output consists of mesh coordinates, elemnents information, the fluid velocity field, and the total flow rate.

Multi-threaded Monte Carlo computation of the vacuum expectation value of phi, phi^2, the magnetization, update acceptance, and autocorrelation for three-dimensional phi^4 field theory. Required interactive user input is the desired number of threads, a random seed, lattice size, coupling kappa, coupling g, a choice for the initial field configuration, an option for heat bath or Metropolis updating, initial field width, update parameter alpha, updating protocol parameters for thermalization, autocorrelation, measurements, and microcanonical updates, and the maximum value of tau for autocorrelations.

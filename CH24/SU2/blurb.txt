A multi-threaded Monte Carlo program to compute average plaquettes and Polyakov loops for SU(2) gauge theory in four dimensions. Creutz heat bath and microcanonical updating are implemented. Input variables are: the lattice size; the coupling beta; a random seed; the number of thermalization, measurement, auto-correlation, and microcanonical (over-relaxation) sweeps; and an option for cold or hot starts.

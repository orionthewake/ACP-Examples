Leap frog Verlet algorithm applied to a disk galaxy in three dimensions. Required input is the number of point masses, the mass of a static supermassive black hole, the galactic radius, an option for the mass distribution, an option for the initial velocity distribution, the force cutoff, the temporal step size, the number of temporal steps, a random seed, and the number of bins for the pair correlation function. Output consists of particle coordinates, the pair correlation function, velocity and particle number profiles, and the mean kinetic and potential energies as a function of time.

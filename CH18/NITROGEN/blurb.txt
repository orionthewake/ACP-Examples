Implent the Verlet algorithm plus Ryckaert method for constrained dyanmics to simulate a gas of rigid N2 molecules. Required input is the number of molecules, the system size, the molecular diameter, the atomic mass, system temperature, the temporal step size, a time to thermalize the system, time interval at which temperature rescaling occurs, the Lennard-Jones potential strength, and the tolerance for Ryckaert iteration. Output is the atomic coordinates, and the temporal dependence of the temperature, internal energy, and total energy.
